I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 255, StatementSignatory: SD Shraddhanand Sharma (Nunsar) 31/5/25 M. 98125-18750., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Today, upon the arrival of the application, and after finding the commission of offense under Section 305, 331(4) BNS, After registration, a copy of the case file along with the original application was taken by me, SI, along with Lady Constable Neelam 1011, and we proceeded to the scene of the incident., RegistrationAndLegal: Case No. 83 dated 31.05.2025 under Section 305, 331(4) BNS was registered at Behal Police Station., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies of the case have been prepared and sent to the Honorable Area Magistrate and Senior Officers via email/online ID rdrspbwn, dspsiwani, loharucourt@aij.gov.in.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 255, StatementSignatory: SD Shraddhanand Sharma (Nunsar) 31/5/25 M. 98125-18750., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Today, upon the arrival of the application, and after finding the commission of offense under Section 305, 331(4) BNS, After registration, a copy of the case file along with the original application was taken by me, SI, along with Lady Constable Neelam 1011, and we proceeded to the scene of the incident., RegistrationAndLegal: Case No. 83 dated 31.05.2025 under Section 305, 331(4) BNS was registered at Behal Police Station., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies of the case have been prepared and sent to the Honorable Area Magistrate and Senior Officers via email/online ID rdrspbwn, dspsiwani, loharucourt@aij.gov.in.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 255, StatementSignatory: SD Shraddhanand Sharma (Nunsar) 31/5/25 M. 98125-18750., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Today, upon the arrival of the application, and after finding the commission of offense under Section 305, 331(4) BNS, After registration, a copy of the case file along with the original application was taken by me, SI, along with Lady Constable Neelam 1011, and we proceeded to the scene of the incident., RegistrationAndLegal: Case No. 83 dated 31.05.2025 under Section 305, 331(4) BNS was registered at Behal Police Station., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies of the case have been prepared and sent to the Honorable Area Magistrate and Senior Officers via email/online ID rdrspbwn, dspsiwani, loharucourt@aij.gov.in.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

An informant met me, ESI, and informed me that <DATE_TIME_000014> there is a fair in <LOCATION_000392> and some people are openly gambling with cards and money in the forest area of <LOCATION_000392>. If a raid is conducted now, they can be caught red-handed with cards and money. Upon this information, I, ESI, informed my colleagues about the tip-off. We went near the forest area of <LOCATION_000392> and, taking cover behind some plants, approached the people gambling. One person said, '<PERSON_001163>, my bet is 500 rupees,' and another said, '<PERSON_001164>, my bet is 1,000 rupees.' At my signal, with the help of my colleagues, we apprehended the people sitting there. They were sitting on a white cloth and had cards and money. Upon seeing the police party, everyone put the money and cards they had in their hands into the cloth. I asked the first person to identify himself, and he said his name was <PERSON_001165> Banwari Lal, a resident of <LOCATION_000393>. The second said his name was <PERSON_001166>, a resident of <LOCATION_000394>. The third said his name was <PERSON_001167> Rajesh, a resident of Bhariwas. The fourth said his name was Harkesh S/o <PERSON_001168>, a resident of Sandwa. The fifth said his name was <PERSON_001169> Dariya <LOCATION_000231>, a resident of <PERSON_001170>. The sixth said his name was <PERSON_001171> <PERSON_001172>, a resident of Thilod. When the money in the cloth was counted, 56 notes of 500 rupees, one note of 200 rupees, and one note of 100 rupees were found, totaling ?28,300. When the cards were counted, there were 52 cards. The recovered ?28,300, 52 playing cards, and a white cloth were taken into police custody as evidence by the <LOCATION_000117>. The 52 cards, ?28,300, and the white cloth were placed in a bundle and sealed with a 'VK' seal. After use, the seal was handed over to Constable Kuldeep 869 as a witness. The accused and the witness signed the memo, and the accused <PERSON_001163> also affixed his right thumb impression.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 264, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": true, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\68.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 12, police_station: CYBER POLICE, fir_date: 18/04/2025, fir_time: 1:00:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NA, 05 Km(s), beat_no: 0, address: NEW DELHI (Over internet), outside_ps_name: nan, name: DR SANJAY JAISWAL, father_name: LT SH MADAN PRASAD JAISWAL, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: POLITICIANS, present_address: 5 TALKATORA ROAD, NEW DELHI, CYBER POLICE STATION NEW DELHI, NEW DELHI, DELHI, 110001, INDIA, 7004632901, permanent_address: nan, section11: THE BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA (BNS), 2023 336(4)/356, inv_officer_number: D-6533, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: VIPIN TYAGI, officer_rank: SI (SUB-INSPECTOR), section15: Information Technology Act, 2000; Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 Sections 334, 338, 351, 352, 356, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: To The Station House Officer Cyber Police Station Mandir Marg. New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4.

Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion.

At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 8:\n[row_id: 150, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: The police arrived shortly after (PCR Call DD No. 133A) and took me to SGM Hospital for medical treatment (MLC No. 17863/25)., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\128.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 388, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 12/6/2025, fir_time: 12:18:00, day_of_week: WEDNESDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: SOUTH-WEST, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: NEAR BALMIKI MANDIR, MCD COLONY, SECTOR-20, ROHINI, outside_ps_name: nan, name: KISHAN, father_name: SHIVLAL, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: MCD cleaning worker, present_address: H.NO. 184, BALBIR VIHAR, AMAN VIHAR, DELHI, AMAN VIHAR, ROHINI, DELHI, INDIA, permanent_address: A-245, Sangam Park, Pratap Bagh, Delhi, section11: THE BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA (BNS), 2023 115(2)/126(2)/3(5), inv_officer_number: 16210096, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: SUMIT TOMAR, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Kishan S/o Shivlal R/o <URL_000001>. 184, <PERSON_000727>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 7:\n[row_id: 52, StatementSignatory: SD ASI Vijay Kumar No. 69/KNL HSNCB UNIT AMBALA DATE 06.01.2025 TIME 08:20 PM., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Today, upon receipt of the above report from EHC Gurmel Singh No. 689/KKR at the police station,, RegistrationAndLegal: FIR No. 004 dated 06.01.2025 under Section 18(c)-61-85 NDPS ACT, Police Station I.Bad, was registered., DispatchAndAssignment: A copy of the police file and the original report are being sent to the investigating officer through EHC Gurmel Singh No. 689/KKR.

A secret informant met me, ASI, and gave confidential information that <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, son of <PERSON_000211>, resident of village <LOCATION_000070>, District Kurukshetra, who is involved in selling opium, will come <DATE_TIME_000014> also from his home in village <LOCATION_000070> towards <LOCATION_000038> Anaj Mandi in his car No. HR41G-5446 Swift, white color, carrying opium.

The informant gave information to me, ASI, and described <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, then left from there. As the information was reliable, I, ASI, at <DATE_TIME_000182>, prepared a separate note for the information of the Station House Officer, <LOCATION_000038>, District Kurukshetra, and sent it through <LOCATION_000071> F.929/GRPH. A notice under Section 42 NDPS Act was prepared and Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, was informed on his mobile number <DATE_TIME_000183><PHONE_NUMBER_000080><US_BANK_NUMBER_000061><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000076>. After that, I, ASI, informed my colleagues about the informant's details and reached <PERSON_000212> gate near HDFC Bank, <LOCATION_000038>, at <DATE_TIME_000184>. HC Surender <PERSON_000202> No. 438/KNL was appointed for videography. We started the barricade and requested passersby to join, but everyone left giving their genuine reasons. After waiting for some time, <PERSON_000214>, son of Shri <PERSON_000215>, resident of Jathlana, Police Station Jathlana, District <LOCATION_000065>, arrived at the spot. He was informed about the informant's details and asked to join the barricade. Shri <PERSON_000214>, son of Shri <PERSON_000215>, resident of Jathlana, Police Station Jathlana, <LOCATION_000072>, agreed to join the barricade and become a public witness. After some time, as informed by the informant, a person driving a car was seen coming from village <LOCATION_000070> towards <LOCATION_000038> Anaj Mandi. He was signaled to stop, and upon seeing the car's number, HR41G-5446 was visible. Upon seeing the police party standing in front, he started to turn the car back. I, ASI, with the help of my colleagues, ran and apprehended him and asked for his name and address. He identified himself as <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, son of <PERSON_000211>, resident of village <LOCATION_000070>, Police Station Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra. I, ASI, identified myself and informed him that there was information about him possessing narcotics and that he and his car would be searched. He was informed of his legal right to have himself and his car searched in front of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer. Upon this, I, ASI, separately prepared a notice under Section 50 NDPS Act and read and explained it to <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> in a language he understood (Hindi). <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the notice. After that, <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, after thinking for a while, gave his consent that he wanted to have himself and his car searched in front of a Gazetted Officer. A separate consent form was prepared, and <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the consent form. After that, I, ASI, at <DATE_TIME_000185>, informed Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, on his mobile number <DATE_TIME_000183><PHONE_NUMBER_000080><US_BANK_NUMBER_000061><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000076> about the situation and requested him to come to the spot. Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, upon receiving the information, arrived at the spot at <DATE_TIME_000186> with his official vehicle and staff. He inspected the notice under Section 42 NDPS Act, notice under Section 50 NDPS Act, and the consent form as per rules. He identified himself to <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and conducted a body search of me, ASI, my colleagues, and the public witness as per rules. No unauthorized items were recovered from me, ASI, my colleagues, or the public witness except for <DATE_TIME_000187> necessities. A separate memo of no recovery was prepared for the body search. <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, the police personnel, me, ASI, and the Gazetted Officer signed the memo. After that, as per the orders of Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, I, ASI, conducted a search of <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and car No. HR41G-5446 as per law. During the search, a black colored polythene was found inside the dashboard of <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>'s car No. HR41G-5446. Upon opening and checking, a black colored narcotic substance was recovered from inside the polythene. Upon my inquiry and as stated by <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, and based on my experience, the recovered substance is opium. A memo of recovery of the narcotic substance was prepared, which was signed by <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses, and verified by the Gazetted Officer. After that, I, ASI, took out the electronic weighing scale available in the official vehicle and weighed the recovered opium along with the polythene, which totaled 400.17 grams. The empty polythene weighed 3.35 grams, and the net weight of the recovered opium was 396.82 grams. The recovered opium along with the polythene was put into a cloth bundle and sealed. I, ASI, affixed my VK/3 seal on the bundle and sealed it, and prepared a separate sample seal by affixing VK/1 seal. The seal, after use, was handed over to witness EASI <PERSON_000207> No. 891/KNL. Thereafter, the Gazetted Officer also affixed his NK/I/1 seal on the bundle of case property (opium) and the sample seal, and kept the seal with him after use. The bundle of case property (opium) and the sample seal were verified and signed by the Gazetted Officer. The recovered bundle of case property (opium) and car No. HR41G-5446 Swift, white color, were taken into police custody as evidence. A separate recovery memo was prepared. The accused <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the recovery memo, and the Gazetted Officer verified the recovery memo. The accused <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> committed a crime under Section 18(c)-61-85 NDPS ACT by possessing 400.17 grams of opium along with the polythene. Upon this, I, ASI, am writing a report to register the case and sending it to EHC <PERSON_000208> No. 689/KKR at Ismailabad Police Station, District Kurukshetra. The case should be registered, and the case number should be informed.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 6:\n[row_id: 150, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: The police arrived shortly after (PCR Call DD No. 133A) and took me to SGM Hospital for medical treatment (MLC No. 17863/25)., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\128.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 388, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 12/6/2025, fir_time: 12:18:00, day_of_week: WEDNESDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: SOUTH-WEST, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: NEAR BALMIKI MANDIR, MCD COLONY, SECTOR-20, ROHINI, outside_ps_name: nan, name: KISHAN, father_name: SHIVLAL, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: MCD cleaning worker, present_address: H.NO. 184, BALBIR VIHAR, AMAN VIHAR, DELHI, AMAN VIHAR, ROHINI, DELHI, INDIA, permanent_address: A-245, Sangam Park, Pratap Bagh, Delhi, section11: THE BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA (BNS), 2023 115(2)/126(2)/3(5), inv_officer_number: 16210096, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: SUMIT TOMAR, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Kishan S/o Shivlal R/o <URL_000001>. 184, <PERSON_000727>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 7:\n[row_id: 255, StatementSignatory: SD Shraddhanand Sharma (Nunsar) 31/5/25 M. 98125-18750., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Today, upon the arrival of the application, and after finding the commission of offense under Section 305, 331(4) BNS, After registration, a copy of the case file along with the original application was taken by me, SI, along with Lady Constable Neelam 1011, and we proceeded to the scene of the incident., RegistrationAndLegal: Case No. 83 dated 31.05.2025 under Section 305, 331(4) BNS was registered at Behal Police Station., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies of the case have been prepared and sent to the Honorable Area Magistrate and Senior Officers via email/online ID rdrspbwn, dspsiwani, loharucourt@aij.gov.in.

The informant gave information to me, ASI, and described <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, then left from there. As the information was reliable, I, ASI, at <DATE_TIME_000182>, prepared a separate note for the information of the Station House Officer, <LOCATION_000038>, District Kurukshetra, and sent it through <LOCATION_000071> F.929/GRPH. A notice under Section 42 NDPS Act was prepared and Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, was informed on his mobile number <DATE_TIME_000183><PHONE_NUMBER_000080><US_BANK_NUMBER_000061><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000076>.

HC Surender <PERSON_000202> No. 438/KNL was appointed for videography. We started the barricade and requested passersby to join, but everyone left giving their genuine reasons. After waiting for some time, <PERSON_000214>, son of Shri <PERSON_000215>, resident of Jathlana, Police Station Jathlana, District <LOCATION_000065>, arrived at the spot.

Shri <PERSON_000214>, son of Shri <PERSON_000215>, resident of Jathlana, Police Station Jathlana, <LOCATION_000072>, agreed to join the barricade and become a public witness. After some time, as informed by the informant, a person driving a car was seen coming from village <LOCATION_000070> towards <LOCATION_000038> Anaj Mandi. He was signaled to stop, and upon seeing the car's number, HR41G-5446 was visible. Upon seeing the police party standing in front, he started to turn the car back. I, ASI, with the help of my colleagues, ran and apprehended him and asked for his name and address. He identified himself as <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, son of <PERSON_000211>, resident of village <LOCATION_000070>, Police Station Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra. I, ASI, identified myself and informed him that there was information about him possessing narcotics and that he and his car would be searched. He was informed of his legal right to have himself and his car searched in front of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer. Upon this, I, ASI, separately prepared a notice under Section 50 NDPS Act and read and explained it to <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> in a language he understood (Hindi). <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the notice. After that, <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, after thinking for a while, gave his consent that he wanted to have himself and his car searched in front of a Gazetted Officer. A separate consent form was prepared, and <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the consent form. After that, I, ASI, at <DATE_TIME_000185>, informed Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, on his mobile number <DATE_TIME_000183><PHONE_NUMBER_000080><US_BANK_NUMBER_000061><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000076> about the situation and requested him to come to the spot. Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, upon receiving the information, arrived at the spot at <DATE_TIME_000186> with his official vehicle and staff. He inspected the notice under Section 42 NDPS Act, notice under Section 50 NDPS Act, and the consent form as per rules. He identified himself to <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and conducted a body search of me, ASI, my colleagues, and the public witness as per rules. No unauthorized items were recovered from me, ASI, my colleagues, or the public witness except for <DATE_TIME_000187> necessities. A separate memo of no recovery was prepared for the body search. <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, the police personnel, me, ASI, and the Gazetted Officer signed the memo. After that, as per the orders of Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, I, ASI, conducted a search of <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and car No. HR41G-5446 as per law. During the search, a black colored polythene was found inside the dashboard of <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>'s car No. HR41G-5446. Upon opening and checking, a black colored narcotic substance was recovered from inside the polythene. Upon my inquiry and as stated by <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, and based on my experience, the recovered substance is opium. A memo of recovery of the narcotic substance was prepared, which was signed by <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses, and verified by the Gazetted Officer. After that, I, ASI, took out the electronic weighing scale available in the official vehicle and weighed the recovered opium along with the polythene, which totaled 400.17 grams. The empty polythene weighed 3.35 grams, and the net weight of the recovered opium was 396.82 grams. The recovered opium along with the polythene was put into a cloth bundle and sealed. I, ASI, affixed my VK/3 seal on the bundle and sealed it, and prepared a separate sample seal by affixing VK/1 seal. The seal, after use, was handed over to witness EASI <PERSON_000207> No. 891/KNL. Thereafter, the Gazetted Officer also affixed his NK/I/1 seal on the bundle of case property (opium) and the sample seal, and kept the seal with him after use. The bundle of case property (opium) and the sample seal were verified and signed by the Gazetted Officer. The recovered bundle of case property (opium) and car No. HR41G-5446 Swift, white color, were taken into police custody as evidence. A separate recovery memo was prepared. The accused <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the recovery memo, and the Gazetted Officer verified the recovery memo. The accused <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> committed a crime under Section 18(c)-61-85 NDPS ACT by possessing 400.17 grams of opium along with the polythene. Upon this, I, ASI, am writing a report to register the case and sending it to EHC <PERSON_000208> No. 689/KKR at Ismailabad Police Station, District Kurukshetra. The case should be registered, and the case number should be informed.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 264, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": true, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\68.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 12, police_station: CYBER POLICE, fir_date: 18/04/2025, fir_time: 1:00:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NA, 05 Km(s), beat_no: 0, address: NEW DELHI (Over internet), outside_ps_name: nan, name: DR SANJAY JAISWAL, father_name: LT SH MADAN PRASAD JAISWAL, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: POLITICIANS, present_address: 5 TALKATORA ROAD, NEW DELHI, CYBER POLICE STATION NEW DELHI, NEW DELHI, DELHI, 110001, INDIA, 7004632901, permanent_address: nan, section11: THE BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA (BNS), 2023 336(4)/356, inv_officer_number: D-6533, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: VIPIN TYAGI, officer_rank: SI (SUB-INSPECTOR), section15: Information Technology Act, 2000; Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 Sections 334, 338, 351, 352, 356, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: To The Station House Officer Cyber Police Station Mandir Marg. New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 182, StatementSignatory: Sd Hindi Suggi; Attested Sd English HC Kailash No. 1016/C., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Duty Officer note: on 09/03/2025 during 8 AMâ8 PM emergency duty, complainant appeared at police station and gave statement; from statement and circumstances, offence U/S 137(2) BNS is made out; rukka prepared., RegistrationAndLegal: Case FIR No. 190/2025 U/S 137(2) BNS registered on CCTNS., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies forwarded as per procedure., _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\25.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 190, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 9/3/2025, fir_time: 23:30:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: N/A, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

A secret informant met me, ASI, and gave confidential information that <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, son of <PERSON_000211>, resident of village <LOCATION_000070>, District Kurukshetra, who is involved in selling opium, will come <DATE_TIME_000014> also from his home in village <LOCATION_000070> towards <LOCATION_000038> Anaj Mandi in his car No. HR41G-5446 Swift, white color, carrying opium.

The informant gave information to me, ASI, and described <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, then left from there. As the information was reliable, I, ASI, at <DATE_TIME_000182>, prepared a separate note for the information of the Station House Officer, <LOCATION_000038>, District Kurukshetra, and sent it through <LOCATION_000071> F.929/GRPH. A notice under Section 42 NDPS Act was prepared and Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, was informed on his mobile number <DATE_TIME_000183><PHONE_NUMBER_000080><US_BANK_NUMBER_000061><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000076>. After that, I, ASI, informed my colleagues about the informant's details and reached <PERSON_000212> gate near HDFC Bank, <LOCATION_000038>, at <DATE_TIME_000184>. HC Surender <PERSON_000202> No. 438/KNL was appointed for videography. We started the barricade and requested passersby to join, but everyone left giving their genuine reasons. After waiting for some time, <PERSON_000214>, son of Shri <PERSON_000215>, resident of Jathlana, Police Station Jathlana, District <LOCATION_000065>, arrived at the spot. He was informed about the informant's details and asked to join the barricade. Shri <PERSON_000214>, son of Shri <PERSON_000215>, resident of Jathlana, Police Station Jathlana, <LOCATION_000072>, agreed to join the barricade and become a public witness. After some time, as informed by the informant, a person driving a car was seen coming from village <LOCATION_000070> towards <LOCATION_000038> Anaj Mandi. He was signaled to stop, and upon seeing the car's number, HR41G-5446 was visible. Upon seeing the police party standing in front, he started to turn the car back. I, ASI, with the help of my colleagues, ran and apprehended him and asked for his name and address. He identified himself as <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, son of <PERSON_000211>, resident of village <LOCATION_000070>, Police Station Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra. I, ASI, identified myself and informed him that there was information about him possessing narcotics and that he and his car would be searched. He was informed of his legal right to have himself and his car searched in front of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer. Upon this, I, ASI, separately prepared a notice under Section 50 NDPS Act and read and explained it to <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> in a language he understood (Hindi). <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the notice. After that, <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, after thinking for a while, gave his consent that he wanted to have himself and his car searched in front of a Gazetted Officer. A separate consent form was prepared, and <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the consent form. After that, I, ASI, at <DATE_TIME_000185>, informed Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, on his mobile number <DATE_TIME_000183><PHONE_NUMBER_000080><US_BANK_NUMBER_000061><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000076> about the situation and requested him to come to the spot. Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, upon receiving the information, arrived at the spot at <DATE_TIME_000186> with his official vehicle and staff. He inspected the notice under Section 42 NDPS Act, notice under Section 50 NDPS Act, and the consent form as per rules. He identified himself to <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and conducted a body search of me, ASI, my colleagues, and the public witness as per rules. No unauthorized items were recovered from me, ASI, my colleagues, or the public witness except for <DATE_TIME_000187> necessities. A separate memo of no recovery was prepared for the body search. <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, the police personnel, me, ASI, and the Gazetted Officer signed the memo. After that, as per the orders of Gazetted Officer Shri <PERSON_000213> HPS DSP Pehowa, District Kurukshetra, I, ASI, conducted a search of <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and car No. HR41G-5446 as per law. During the search, a black colored polythene was found inside the dashboard of <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>'s car No. HR41G-5446. Upon opening and checking, a black colored narcotic substance was recovered from inside the polythene. Upon my inquiry and as stated by <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210>, and based on my experience, the recovered substance is opium. A memo of recovery of the narcotic substance was prepared, which was signed by <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses, and verified by the Gazetted Officer. After that, I, ASI, took out the electronic weighing scale available in the official vehicle and weighed the recovered opium along with the polythene, which totaled 400.17 grams. The empty polythene weighed 3.35 grams, and the net weight of the recovered opium was 396.82 grams. The recovered opium along with the polythene was put into a cloth bundle and sealed. I, ASI, affixed my VK/3 seal on the bundle and sealed it, and prepared a separate sample seal by affixing VK/1 seal. The seal, after use, was handed over to witness EASI <PERSON_000207> No. 891/KNL. Thereafter, the Gazetted Officer also affixed his NK/I/1 seal on the bundle of case property (opium) and the sample seal, and kept the seal with him after use. The bundle of case property (opium) and the sample seal were verified and signed by the Gazetted Officer. The recovered bundle of case property (opium) and car No. HR41G-5446 Swift, white color, were taken into police custody as evidence. A separate recovery memo was prepared. The accused <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> and the witnesses signed the recovery memo, and the Gazetted Officer verified the recovery memo. The accused <PERSON_000209> alias <PERSON_000210> committed a crime under Section 18(c)-61-85 NDPS ACT by possessing 400.17 grams of opium along with the polythene. Upon this, I, ASI, am writing a report to register the case and sending it to EHC <PERSON_000208> No. 689/KKR at Ismailabad Police Station, District Kurukshetra. The case should be registered, and the case number should be informed.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

I am 7 months pregnant. Sir, my marriage with <PERSON_000540> took place on <DATE_TIME_000456> with full pomp according to <NRP_000012> rites and customs in the presence of both families and other relatives. My maternal family gave all wedding items beyond their capacity. <DATE_TIME_000457> before the wedding, my in-laws demanded about two lakhs in cash from my family, and at that time my family arranged one lakh rupees and handed that amount to my in-laws. After that everything went well for <DATE_TIME_000458>. But thereafter my husband, my mother-in-law, both my sisters-in-law, and their husbands started continuously taunting me for bringing less dowry and forbade me to speak to anyone in the neighborhood. Moreover, they kept demanding dowry from my family and on these issues used to beat me over small matters and continuously harassed me. I would like to tell you that before my marriage, when I was <DATE_TIME_000459>, one of our relatives tried to do something wrong with me; I told my family about it, and then the accused relative and his family admitted their mistake and, due to fear of public shame, my family did not take any legal action. My in-laws were informed about this before the marriage. At the time of the marriage they said, âNo matter, adopting such a girl will bring us divine reward from Allah, and it is our good fortune.â But after marriage, I was continuously taunted regarding this incident; my character was questioned and abusive words were used against me. It was said, âYou are a prostitute; we made a mistake by accepting you,â and they kept demanding dowry and beating me. Even though my husband knew everything about this matter, under the influence of my mother-in-law and sisters-in-law he beat me and hurled filthy abuses at me, saying, âYou are a prostitute.â The limit of harassment went so far that before this pregnancy, when I was <DATE_TIME_000460> pregnant, my husband beat me so much that I started bleeding, and my husband made me take some pills and then I had to undergo a cleaning (D&C) at Tulsi Hospital. My husband wants to leave me and marry another girl, and his family is supporting him. They constantly doubt me and keep conspiring against meâmaking false videos. They have even installed cameras in my bedroom. I objected many times, but even now cameras are installed in my bedroom. On <DATE_TIME_000461>, my husband <PERSON_000540> suddenly left me at my parental home in <PERSON_000219> saying he had to go out for <DATE_TIME_000462> and that since I was pregnant I should stay at my parentsâ house and he would take me back when he returned. But since then, <DATE_TIME_000463> passed, and when I was <DATE_TIME_000464> pregnant I was given some medicines which another doctor strictly forbade me to take. Despite my being pregnant, my husband neither came to take me nor did he answer my calls or those of any member of my family. My sister-in-law and my husband accused me of theft, whereas no one else lives in my house except my husband and me, and I am not even allowed to go outside. When he left me at my parental home, my husband himself packed all my belongings and did not even allow me to keep my things; he even checked my purse before sending me. <DATE_TIME_000393>, in a socially held panchayat meeting he agreed to take me back, but the very <DATE_TIME_000465> he made a false complaint against me and my family at <LOCATION_000163>, <LOCATION_000162> outpost. Despite several calls from the police, my husband did not come to the outpost. I want to go and live with my husband at my in-lawsâ home, and I want to live happily with my husband and my unborn child. But my husband does not care about my condition nor is he concerned about the coming child. My husband, my two sisters-in-law, and their husbands are constantly conspiring against me. I am very troubled by all this, and because of me my parents too are troubled. Now, being distressed by all this, I feel like ending my life and taking my own life, because if I die, then my unborn child will also not come into this world. And this is what my husband and in-laws want. My husband and in-laws say they want to end relations with me and my family and want me to die so that my husbandâs path becomes clear. My husband and in-laws have taken all my jewelry from me; my husband and in-laws took all my jewelry, even my toe rings. Therefore, I now want justice for myself and my unborn child.]\nTable 2:\n[row_id: 18, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": false}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\48.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 181, police_station: ANAND PARBAT, fir_date: 3/3/2025, fir_time: 18:45:00, day_of_week: SATURDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH-WEST, 1.0 Km(s), beat_no: 7, address: H.

New Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000098> Subject: Complaint regarding circulation of a morphed and defamatory video on Youtube & Facebook targeting my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, former Member of Parliament, I, Dr. <PERSON_001241>, Member of Parliament (<PERSON_001242>), am filing this complaint to bring to your urgent attention the circulation of a defamatory video that has been uploaded and publicly shared on Youtube and via Facebook through the following links: <URL_000032> <URL_000033> <URL_000034> <URL_000035> The video in question contains edited footage, where disparate clips have been selectively cut, and presented in a manner to falsely portray and defame both my late father, Shri Madan <PERSON_001240>, and myself. My father served with great distinction as a three-time Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>, and was deeply respected for his contributions as a public servant and medical professional. I, too, am a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) and currently serve as the sitting Member of Parliament from the same constituency, carrying forward his legacy with integrity and commitment to public welfare. This is an attempt to tarnish the image of my family which has dedicated its entire life to public service. The individuals operating under the name News Hunters have egregiously misused their digital media platform to circulate a misleading, and defamatory video targeting both my late father, Dr. <PERSON_001244>, and myself. They openly state in their description that they are \"not news reporters\" but \"hunters,\" claiming to uncover the \"stories behind the news,\" operating under the parent body Hunt The Haunted, accessible at <URL_000036>. Their YouTube channel @News Hunters was created on <DATE_TIME_001017> and, as of now, boasts 76,000 subscribers, over 839 videos, and more than 33 million views highlighting their wide reach and potential to mislead the public at scale. They also maintain an active presence on Facebook and Twitter, aggressively amplifying such sensationalist and politically motivated content. Despite claiming to promote well-researched content on <LOCATION_000030>'s culture, politics, and history, they have instead indulged in manipulation of facts, deliberate distortion of statements, and unethical targeting of public figures. Such actions are not only defamatory but deeply damaging in <DATE_TIME_001018> and warrant immediate and stringent legal action. The subject line accompanying the video is not only misleading but deliberately crafted to provoke public outrage and discredit both of us. In the absence of any genuine controversy or allegation against me, it is evident that those with vested interests have resorted to maligning my father's memory in order to indirectly target and damage my public image. This is a calculated attempt to distort public perception, particularly with the <LOCATION_000030> elections approaching, and must be dealt with urgently and firmly under the law. Such a caption misconstrues the actual content and intent of the clips, presenting them out of context to imply wrongdoing or controversy where none exists. This deliberate misrepresentation is a calculated attempt to diminish the respect he commanded as a statesman and physician, and it causes deep anguish to those who hold him in high esteem even <DATE_TIME_000014>. The video mischievously includes a statement by <PERSON_001245>, claiming that \"kidnapping started from Bettiah,\" while omitting the serious context in which my late father had himself publicly stated that he was, in fact, threatened by <PERSON_001245> with being kidnapped. By selectively and cynically presenting such statements without context or truth and adding a tagline allegedly calling my late father \"Bettiah ka bacha chor\", the video distorts facts to stoke sensationalism and deliberately attempts to character-assassinate two elected representatives who have served <LOCATION_000030> with integrity and distinction. Dr. <PERSON_001244>, my late father, was a highly respected and distinguished individual who served the nation in multiple capacities. He was a qualified medical doctor (<PERSON_001243>), a social worker, and a three-time elected Member of Parliament from <LOCATION_000414>, <LOCATION_000030>. Prior to his tenure in <PERSON_001246>, he served as a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and also held the position of Chairman of the Municipal Council in Bettiah. It is deeply distressing that such a noble figure's legacy is being tarnished by the circulation of a manipulated and defamatory video. The circulation of this video and its defamatory subject line is also a direct attack on my public image and credibility as the sitting Member of Parliament (fourth time) from <LOCATION_000415>, <LOCATION_000030>. I have dedicated my life to public service and continue to be actively involved in developmental and legislative work. As a qualified medical practitioner (<PERSON_001243>) myself, in addition to being a Member of Parliament, I find such defamatory acts not only personally hurtful but also professionally unethical, as they undermine the values of public trust and integrity that I have upheld throughout my career. In the absence of any credible allegations or controversies against me, it is evident that vested interests are now resorting to targeting my late father's legacy in a desperate attempt to malign my image and derail my public standing ahead of the <LOCATION_000030> elections. This maliciously altered content not only tarnishes the image of a respected public figure who is no longer alive to defend himself, but also causes serious emotional and reputational damage to our family and the community that continues to honour his legacy. It appears that the intent behind the creation and circulation of this video is to malign, misinform, and provoke public misunderstanding, which could also amount to mischief under various provisions of law. I respectfully request the following action: 1. Immediate registration of an FIR under appropriate sections of relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, <DATE_TIME_000652>. 2. That appropriate legal action be initiated against the founder and administrator of the YouTube channel News Hunters and its parent body Hunt The Haunted, for their direct role in conceptualizing, approving and disseminating defamatory and manipulated content with malicious intent. Their accountability must be fixed under applicable provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Information Technology Act, and any other relevant laws, considering the widespread impact and wilful propagation of false information from their platform. 3. The morphed and defamatory video is punishable under Sections 334 (Forgery), 338 (Using forged electronic record as genuine), 351 (Public mischief). 352 (Intentional insult), and 356 (Defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, <DATE_TIME_000818>. 4. Issuance of necessary directions to Facebook India/Meta Platforms Inc. to take down the said video and furnish the IP address, email ID, phone number, and any other verifiable information of the account holder responsible for circulating the video and all accounts who have reposted it. 5. Strict legal action against the individual(s) found responsible for creating, editing, or circulating the video. 6. Preservation of all related digital evidence to avoid any tampering or deletion. I am enclosing screenshots, the video link, and a brief summary of the objectionable content for your reference. I am available to provide any further clarification or assistance required in the course of the investigation.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 153, StatementSignatory: -sd- English Malti Attested by SI Anil Balayan PS Aman Vihar 09/06/25, PreliminaryPoliceAction: After questioning, my statement was recorded at the Aman Vihar Police Station, which I have read and found to be correct., RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\125.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 385, police_station: AMAN VIHAR, fir_date: 9/6/2025, fir_time: 18:51:00, day_of_week: MONDAY, info_type: Written, direction_distance: NORTH, 1.5 Km(s), beat_no: 2, address: D-1/10 Balbir Vihar Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MALTI, father_name: ARVIND, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: SHOPKEEPER, present_address: D-137, Balbir Vihar Masjid, Wali Gali Aman Vihar, Delhi-110086, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 115(2)/118(1)/351(2), inv_officer_number: 27160033, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: Anil Balayan, officer_rank: SI, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: Statement of Malti W/o Arvind R/o D-137, <PERSON_000739> <PERSON_000740> Delhi-<US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000159> <DATE_TIME_000609> Ph No. <PHONE_NUMBER_000194><US_BANK_NUMBER_000166><US_DRIVER_LICENSE_000197>.

Complainant <PERSON_000900> (Sikh Community) had a love-cum-arranged marriage with <PERSON_000901> (Brahmin caste) on <DATE_TIME_000804> in <LOCATION_000194>. 2. The husband pressured the complainant to take a loan of â¹6 Lakhs (from HDFC) for the wedding expenses, with an agreement to share the repayment. The entire financial burden, totaling â¹11 Lakhs of the complainant's money (including â¹5 Lakhs savings and â¹6 Lakhs loan), eventually fell on her, as the husband was not financially stable. 3. The husband also took â¹2 Lakhs cash from the loan amount for clothes and travel expenses. The family was gifted items worth â¹9 Lakhs (Gold & Silver) and â¹3.5 Lakhs (additional items), including cash of â¹3,50,000/- but remained unsatisfied and taunted the complainant for the 'low-quality' dowry. 4. The in-laws constantly made defamatory remarks about her caste and religion (<NRP_000027>/Punjabi), saying her \"DNA is dirty\" and calling her family 'beggars' ('<PERSON_000902>') and saying they were 'cheated' by marrying into her family. 5. The husband slapped her in front of family members <DATE_TIME_000805> after the marriage and frequently humiliated her. When she retaliated, he dismissed it as 'just a joke.' 6. The mother-in-law (<PERSON_000903>) took all her money and jewelry (Stridhan) given as gifts under the pretext of 'safekeeping' and has not returned them (406 IPC). 7. She was not allowed to wear the traditional wedding bangle 'Chooda' because it was a symbol of a different caste. 8. The mother-in-law and sister-in-law (<PERSON_000904>) would create quarrels to prevent the couple from consummating the marriage or spending quality time together. They canceled their honeymoon trip, stating it wasn't their culture, and insulted her, saying, \"Your wife came from a foreign land, only the skin is fair, but her parents gave her no values.\" 9. The husband always treated her badly, saying he married her only for financial help and to use her money, threatening she could leave otherwise. He often used emotional blackmail regarding his parents' health to extract money and used to fight with her by slapping and pulling her hair. 10. The sister-in-law (<PERSON_000905>) told her to leave the house within <DATE_TIME_000806>, made defamatory remarks on her caste, and, along with the husband, taunted her by saying, \"Your father gave you away as charity to us to get rid of his trouble\". <PERSON_000905> also tried to burn her hand in the kitchen to 'teach her a lesson' for speaking up and threatened to kill her. 11. The elder brother-in-law (<PERSON_000906>) and his wife (<PERSON_000904>) were the main conspirators. They defamed her due to her caste. The brother-in-law did not attend the wedding and later sent her an indecent message calling her \"NANGI-PUNGI\". The husband ignored the message when shown. 12. The mother-in-law used to treat her like a maid, throwing things at her, and once threw a hot cup of tea on her, saying, \"What rubbish tea you made, didn't your mother teach you anything?\" She constantly forced the husband to choose between his mother and his wife, leading to severe beatings. 13. The in-laws were against her job. The husband forced her to quit her job in <LOCATION_000006>. Her sister-in-law (<PERSON_000907>) <PERSON_000904> would instigate the husband, saying, \"Your wife doesn't respect you because she earns more than you.\" 14. The in-laws, especially the mother-in-law and sister-in-law <PERSON_000904>, called Pundits (priests) to the house on two occasions (one in <DATE_TIME_000779> and one after she fainted during <DATE_TIME_000807>) and spread falsehoods in the neighborhood that the complainant was 'possessed' by a spirit and mentally unstable, and that her treatment should be done by '<PERSON_000908> (exorcism). 15. During the Diwali 2023 incident, her brother-in-law (<PERSON_000906>) threatened to ruin her and her family and said her DNA was 'dirty'. Her father arrived and found the family chanting mantras and throwing sacred ash ('<PERSON_000909>') on her. He rescued her and brought her back to <LOCATION_000006> on <DATE_TIME_000808>. 16. Her in-laws confiscated all her wedding articles and belongings (Stridhan). 17. The husband is only interested in her money and forced her to make him a nominee on her LIC policy. 18. The husband and in-laws have completely cut ties, didn't inform her of her father-in-law's death (<DATE_TIME_000809>), and refused to let her attend her uncle's and aunt's funerals, citing her different caste. 19. Even after she left, the sisters continue to abuse her character, saying, \"Both mother and daughter are running a business in <LOCATION_000006> to trap boys from good families\". The husband also threatened her to quietly get a divorce or he would spoil her life and put her in a rehabilitation center to prove she is mentally unstable.

My marriage took place on <DATE_TIME_001079> in the <LOCATION_000433> area. Within <DATE_TIME_001080>, my mother-in-law (<PERSON_000091>) and my sister-in-law (<PERSON_000092>) started taunting me and complaining about me to the maid. After my marriage, when I went to my mother's house for <PERSON_000886>, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law prevented my husband from coming to pick me up. My sister-in-law used to live at my matrimonial home and instigated my mother-in-law and husband against me. At their behest, they used to beat me severely and tell me to leave the house. At that time I was Pregnant and they asked me to abort the child. When I refused, my husband and mother-in-law would beat me and send me to my mother's house. During that time, they would block me and not speak to me, which caused me severe Mental Torture. My husband would constantly ask me for money to fulfill his needs and would deceive me into giving him money. All the savings I had before marriage were given to my husband, who promised to return them but never did. My mother-in-law told my husband to Divorce me and that they would arrange his second marriage. They put a lot of pressure on me to give them money, threatening to divorce me and remarry if I didn't comply. To save my home, I used to give them money. My husband would come home drunk every other day. When I forbade him from drinking, he would beat me badly, even during my pregnancy. His sister said, \"What's it to you? Let him drink, he's fulfilling your desires,\" even though neither my husband nor my mother-in-law ever bought me a single pair of clothes. My mother-in-law told me, \"I give clothes to <PERSON_000747> from my own side, so tell your mother to get you clothes.\" I told her that my father is not alive and my mother runs the household expenses with great difficulty, but they did not listen. My mother-in-law told me, \"Either I will stay in this house, or you will.\" She said this in front of my father-in-law, but he never said anything to her. He would see me being beaten by my mother-in-law and husband but never intervened. At my husband's insistence, I asked my mother for â¹2 Lakhs because he threatened to leave me if I didn't get the money. I took <DATE_TIME_001081> from my mother and transferred the entire amount to my husband as per his need via Bank Transfer. When I didn't have money to give them, they would mentally and physically torture me greatly. <DATE_TIME_001082>, when my father-in-law was eating stale bread, I took fresh bread for him. My mother-in-law taunted me, saying, \"Look, she brought bread, eat this.\" That morning, she created a lot of commotion over this. My husband was not even available at the hospital when my mother admitted me. When my daughter was born, neither my husband nor any member of my in-laws' family was available at the hospital. My mother took care of me and my daughter because my mother-in-law completely refused to help. In <DATE_TIME_001083> of my pregnancy, my husband took me to my mother's house. During that time, his mother was not talking to him. We stayed at my mother's house for <DATE_TIME_000834> because my in-laws did not want to take care of me and my daughter. Even after I, my daughter, and my husband returned home, they did not behave properly with me and they wouldn't even hold my child, only doing so when I was doing housework. We returned home in <DATE_TIME_001084>. On my wedding anniversary, <DATE_TIME_001085>, my mother-in-law organized a <LOCATION_000434> at my matrimonial home. My husband, his brother-in-law, and his cousins were sitting together and drinking. When I picked up an empty plate from there, my sister-in-law <PERSON_000092> created a big fuss <DATE_TIME_001086>, <DATE_TIME_001087>. The argument escalated, and my husband beat me and dropped me off at my mother's house and never came back to pick me up. I stayed at my mother's house until <DATE_TIME_001088>. They blocked me at the insistence of his mother and sister, and would not talk to me, saying they would leave me and didn't want to live with me. I filed a Complaint at Welcome Police Station. A Senior Officer counseled me and my husband. After that, I returned to my husband's house by a cab, the fare for which was paid by my mother. After <DATE_TIME_000031> of arguments, my mother-in-law sent me back to my mother's house. Then my husband told me that his family members did not want to live with me and that his brother-in-law <PERSON_001328> advised him to live with me in a rented house, promising they would look after me and my daughter. So, in <DATE_TIME_001089>, I shifted with him to a rented house in <LOCATION_000005>. All my Gold items were kept by his family, and they took my signature on a paper stating that they had returned all my gold, but they only returned small pieces. My husband said his mother was not home, and he would bring the rest later, but he never gave me anything back. I did not want any dispute at that time, so I accepted everything they said. On my husband's birthday, <DATE_TIME_001090>, he beat me badly, saying he was living with me leaving his parents. On <DATE_TIME_001091>, my husband also physically and mentally tortured me a lot. I wanted to save my home, so I never filed a case against my husband or sought any hospital examination, as I didn't want him to get into trouble. On my daughter's 1st birthday, <DATE_TIME_001092>, my husband beat me badly. In <DATE_TIME_001093>, I joined a Job to support my husband financially, as he was not managing household expenses properly, which caused me to incur a lot of debt. I started the job to pay off the debt and run the house properly, but my husband never let me utilize my earned money properly. My husband still asked me for money and did not give me money for household expenses. My husband took a loan from Muthoot using the small gold items my in-laws had returned, and then took that money from me via transfer for his own needs. My husband worked at DHL, but lost his job in Sep or <DATE_TIME_001094> due to some Fraud. He asked me for â¹55,000 to give there. When I didn't have the money, he verbally abused me and mentally tortured me. My husband used to slap me, punch me in the stomach, and pull my hair. He would say, \"Have you ever looked at yourself? I wouldn't even give a girl like you a second glance.\" This hurt me greatly. He called me a crazy woman and mentally depressed, even though they all together mentally tortured me. My mother-in-law and husband beat me a lot. During my confinement after childbirth (Japa), my husband punched me in the stomach in front of my mother and younger brother, even though I had stitches at that time. My husband was unemployed for <DATE_TIME_001095> until <DATE_TIME_000816>. During this time, I was working to run the house, but my husband would drink and cause trouble. In <DATE_TIME_001096>, my husband said he wanted to start a business and asked me to arrange some money until his PF amount arrived. I thought he might improve, so I talked to my friend <PERSON_001329> and started a partnership business named AARVI COLLECTIONS in <DATE_TIME_001097>, which put me in debt of about â¹2 Lakh to <PERSON_001330>, which I am unable to repay. After that, my mother-in-law refused to keep my daughter, so in <DATE_TIME_001098>, I shifted to a rented house in <PERSON_001331>. Despite all this, my husband did not change. He joined a job at SHIP GLOBAL in <DATE_TIME_000816> and never paid attention to the business, losing approximately â¹2.5 to 3 Lakhs. Because of my husband, I have transferred about â¹10 to 10.30 Lakhs to him from my bank account over <DATE_TIME_001099> to fulfill his needs. I am heavily in debt because of him. I have also made several payments for his Private Loan Apps from my account. Then he used my Aadhar and 2 PANs to create accounts on those loan apps and took money, which I gave to him at his insistence, and he never repaid. I paid many installments for the iPhone he bought from my account. I also paid many installments for the <PERSON_001332> loan from my account. My husband did not give me money for household expenses. I also transferred money many times to repay his sister's â¹55,000. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law do not want me to be happy with my husband. Before <LOCATION_000298> in <DATE_TIME_001100>, my husband hit me by grabbing my hair. When I asked him to let me go, he closed the gate and beat me severely over this. During this time, I started feeling very unwell due to the dust and dirt from work. When I asked my husband to bring me medicine, he would beat me then too. <DATE_TIME_000534>, the matter would be sorted out, and to save my marriage, I never filed a complaint or got a medical examination. My elder brother passed away in <DATE_TIME_001101>. I came to my mother's house after asking him. They did not let me live with them. I would go home, clean, and come back. Sometimes I would stay for <DATE_TIME_001102>, but they did not treat me lovingly. When I asked my husband for money for household expenses, he would not give any, which led to fights and mutual verbal abuse. <DATE_TIME_001103>, when I was at my mother's house, he came home at <DATE_TIME_001104>, drunk. I told him to come to the police station now, asking if this was the time to come home. Then he took me from my house and took me to a secluded road and beat me severely on the road itself. After that, when I filed a complaint against him and his family at <LOCATION_000435> on 06/April/2024, he left me and went to live with his mother in a rented house. Despite my much pleading, he did not return. My husband often came home late, drunk, and caused trouble. I am very frustrated with his behavior, to the extent that I cannot even focus on my child's future because he has mentally tortured me so much. Since my marriage, my sister-in-law <PERSON_000092> and her husband <PERSON_001328> were living at my matrimonial home. They instigated my mother-in-law and husband against me. <DATE_TIME_001105> after the marriage, my mother-in-law, husband, and sister-in-law physically assaulted me multiple times. Even after she moved to her own house, she would visit my matrimonial home every <DATE_TIME_001106> and interfere a lot, calling my mother-in-law <DATE_TIME_000787> and taking all the news of the house. My sister-in-law and her husband asked me what problem I had with my husband, saying, \"He only drinks, he is doing everything for you, right?\" But I did not like my husband drinking. My in-laws and father-in-law listened only to my sister-in-law and her husband, and all work was done as per their instruction. At the behest of my brother-in-law, my in-laws and father-in-law expelled my husband and me from the house, and disowned us for show, forcing us to live in a rented house. They did not want me to live happily in my matrimonial home. My mother-in-law and husband would often snatch my phone at my sister-in-law's insistence so that I could not take any action against them or talk to my mother at home.]\nTable 5:\n[row_id: 290, StatementSignatory: Sd.

Complainant <PERSON_000900> (Sikh Community) had a love-cum-arranged marriage with <PERSON_000901> (Brahmin caste) on <DATE_TIME_000804> in <LOCATION_000194>. 2. The husband pressured the complainant to take a loan of â¹6 Lakhs (from HDFC) for the wedding expenses, with an agreement to share the repayment. The entire financial burden, totaling â¹11 Lakhs of the complainant's money (including â¹5 Lakhs savings and â¹6 Lakhs loan), eventually fell on her, as the husband was not financially stable. 3. The husband also took â¹2 Lakhs cash from the loan amount for clothes and travel expenses. The family was gifted items worth â¹9 Lakhs (Gold & Silver) and â¹3.5 Lakhs (additional items), including cash of â¹3,50,000/- but remained unsatisfied and taunted the complainant for the 'low-quality' dowry. 4. The in-laws constantly made defamatory remarks about her caste and religion (<NRP_000027>/Punjabi), saying her \"DNA is dirty\" and calling her family 'beggars' ('<PERSON_000902>') and saying they were 'cheated' by marrying into her family. 5. The husband slapped her in front of family members <DATE_TIME_000805> after the marriage and frequently humiliated her. When she retaliated, he dismissed it as 'just a joke.' 6. The mother-in-law (<PERSON_000903>) took all her money and jewelry (Stridhan) given as gifts under the pretext of 'safekeeping' and has not returned them (406 IPC). 7. She was not allowed to wear the traditional wedding bangle 'Chooda' because it was a symbol of a different caste. 8. The mother-in-law and sister-in-law (<PERSON_000904>) would create quarrels to prevent the couple from consummating the marriage or spending quality time together. They canceled their honeymoon trip, stating it wasn't their culture, and insulted her, saying, \"Your wife came from a foreign land, only the skin is fair, but her parents gave her no values.\" 9. The husband always treated her badly, saying he married her only for financial help and to use her money, threatening she could leave otherwise. He often used emotional blackmail regarding his parents' health to extract money and used to fight with her by slapping and pulling her hair. 10. The sister-in-law (<PERSON_000905>) told her to leave the house within <DATE_TIME_000806>, made defamatory remarks on her caste, and, along with the husband, taunted her by saying, \"Your father gave you away as charity to us to get rid of his trouble\". <PERSON_000905> also tried to burn her hand in the kitchen to 'teach her a lesson' for speaking up and threatened to kill her. 11. The elder brother-in-law (<PERSON_000906>) and his wife (<PERSON_000904>) were the main conspirators. They defamed her due to her caste. The brother-in-law did not attend the wedding and later sent her an indecent message calling her \"NANGI-PUNGI\". The husband ignored the message when shown. 12. The mother-in-law used to treat her like a maid, throwing things at her, and once threw a hot cup of tea on her, saying, \"What rubbish tea you made, didn't your mother teach you anything?\" She constantly forced the husband to choose between his mother and his wife, leading to severe beatings. 13. The in-laws were against her job. The husband forced her to quit her job in <LOCATION_000006>. Her sister-in-law (<PERSON_000907>) <PERSON_000904> would instigate the husband, saying, \"Your wife doesn't respect you because she earns more than you.\" 14. The in-laws, especially the mother-in-law and sister-in-law <PERSON_000904>, called Pundits (priests) to the house on two occasions (one in <DATE_TIME_000779> and one after she fainted during <DATE_TIME_000807>) and spread falsehoods in the neighborhood that the complainant was 'possessed' by a spirit and mentally unstable, and that her treatment should be done by '<PERSON_000908> (exorcism). 15. During the Diwali 2023 incident, her brother-in-law (<PERSON_000906>) threatened to ruin her and her family and said her DNA was 'dirty'. Her father arrived and found the family chanting mantras and throwing sacred ash ('<PERSON_000909>') on her. He rescued her and brought her back to <LOCATION_000006> on <DATE_TIME_000808>. 16. Her in-laws confiscated all her wedding articles and belongings (Stridhan). 17. The husband is only interested in her money and forced her to make him a nominee on her LIC policy. 18. The husband and in-laws have completely cut ties, didn't inform her of her father-in-law's death (<DATE_TIME_000809>), and refused to let her attend her uncle's and aunt's funerals, citing her different caste. 19. Even after she left, the sisters continue to abuse her character, saying, \"Both mother and daughter are running a business in <LOCATION_000006> to trap boys from good families\". The husband also threatened her to quietly get a divorce or he would spoil her life and put her in a rehabilitation center to prove she is mentally unstable. Prayer: Request for immediate legal action against all 8 accused persons for cruelty, dowry harassment, criminal breach of trust, and other offenses.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 278, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRDelhiTranslated\\71.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 326, police_station: WELCOME, fir_date: 24/06/2025, fir_time: 2:25:00, day_of_week: Tuesday, info_type: Written, direction_distance: EAST, 30 Km(s), beat_no: 50, address: 414, Pole No. 35, Mitraon Najaf Garh, Delhi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: MONIKA SHARMA, father_name: RAHUL GAUR, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: NOT KNOWN, present_address: 10038 A/4, West Gorakh Park, Shahdara, Delhi, Welcome, North East, Delhi, India, permanent_address: nan, section11: BNS 85/351(1)/3(5), IPC 498A/506/34, inv_officer_number: 28010234, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: nan, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: VISHAL KUMAR, officer_rank: ASST.

At that time I was Pregnant and they asked me to abort the child. When I refused, my husband and mother-in-law would beat me and send me to my mother's house. During that time, they would block me and not speak to me, which caused me severe Mental Torture. My husband would constantly ask me for money to fulfill his needs and would deceive me into giving him money. All the savings I had before marriage were given to my husband, who promised to return them but never did. My mother-in-law told my husband to Divorce me and that they would arrange his second marriage. They put a lot of pressure on me to give them money, threatening to divorce me and remarry if I didn't comply. To save my home, I used to give them money. My husband would come home drunk every other day. When I forbade him from drinking, he would beat me badly, even during my pregnancy. His sister said, \"What's it to you? Let him drink, he's fulfilling your desires,\" even though neither my husband nor my mother-in-law ever bought me a single pair of clothes. My mother-in-law told me, \"I give clothes to <PERSON_000747> from my own side, so tell your mother to get you clothes.\" I told her that my father is not alive and my mother runs the household expenses with great difficulty, but they did not listen. My mother-in-law told me, \"Either I will stay in this house, or you will.\" She said this in front of my father-in-law, but he never said anything to her. He would see me being beaten by my mother-in-law and husband but never intervened. At my husband's insistence, I asked my mother for â¹2 Lakhs because he threatened to leave me if I didn't get the money. I took <DATE_TIME_001081> from my mother and transferred the entire amount to my husband as per his need via Bank Transfer. When I didn't have money to give them, they would mentally and physically torture me greatly. <DATE_TIME_001082>, when my father-in-law was eating stale bread, I took fresh bread for him. My mother-in-law taunted me, saying, \"Look, she brought bread, eat this.\" That morning, she created a lot of commotion over this. My husband was not even available at the hospital when my mother admitted me. When my daughter was born, neither my husband nor any member of my in-laws' family was available at the hospital. My mother took care of me and my daughter because my mother-in-law completely refused to help. In <DATE_TIME_001083> of my pregnancy, my husband took me to my mother's house. During that time, his mother was not talking to him. We stayed at my mother's house for <DATE_TIME_000834> because my in-laws did not want to take care of me and my daughter. Even after I, my daughter, and my husband returned home, they did not behave properly with me and they wouldn't even hold my child, only doing so when I was doing housework. We returned home in <DATE_TIME_001084>. On my wedding anniversary, <DATE_TIME_001085>, my mother-in-law organized a <LOCATION_000434> at my matrimonial home. My husband, his brother-in-law, and his cousins were sitting together and drinking. When I picked up an empty plate from there, my sister-in-law <PERSON_000092> created a big fuss <DATE_TIME_001086>, <DATE_TIME_001087>. The argument escalated, and my husband beat me and dropped me off at my mother's house and never came back to pick me up. I stayed at my mother's house until <DATE_TIME_001088>. They blocked me at the insistence of his mother and sister, and would not talk to me, saying they would leave me and didn't want to live with me. I filed a Complaint at Welcome Police Station. A Senior Officer counseled me and my husband. After that, I returned to my husband's house by a cab, the fare for which was paid by my mother. After <DATE_TIME_000031> of arguments, my mother-in-law sent me back to my mother's house. Then my husband told me that his family members did not want to live with me and that his brother-in-law <PERSON_001328> advised him to live with me in a rented house, promising they would look after me and my daughter. So, in <DATE_TIME_001089>, I shifted with him to a rented house in <LOCATION_000005>. All my Gold items were kept by his family, and they took my signature on a paper stating that they had returned all my gold, but they only returned small pieces. My husband said his mother was not home, and he would bring the rest later, but he never gave me anything back. I did not want any dispute at that time, so I accepted everything they said. On my husband's birthday, <DATE_TIME_001090>, he beat me badly, saying he was living with me leaving his parents. On <DATE_TIME_001091>, my husband also physically and mentally tortured me a lot. I wanted to save my home, so I never filed a case against my husband or sought any hospital examination, as I didn't want him to get into trouble. On my daughter's 1st birthday, <DATE_TIME_001092>, my husband beat me badly. In <DATE_TIME_001093>, I joined a Job to support my husband financially, as he was not managing household expenses properly, which caused me to incur a lot of debt. I started the job to pay off the debt and run the house properly, but my husband never let me utilize my earned money properly. My husband still asked me for money and did not give me money for household expenses. My husband took a loan from Muthoot using the small gold items my in-laws had returned, and then took that money from me via transfer for his own needs. My husband worked at DHL, but lost his job in Sep or <DATE_TIME_001094> due to some Fraud. He asked me for â¹55,000 to give there. When I didn't have the money, he verbally abused me and mentally tortured me. My husband used to slap me, punch me in the stomach, and pull my hair. He would say, \"Have you ever looked at yourself? I wouldn't even give a girl like you a second glance.\" This hurt me greatly. He called me a crazy woman and mentally depressed, even though they all together mentally tortured me. My mother-in-law and husband beat me a lot. During my confinement after childbirth (Japa), my husband punched me in the stomach in front of my mother and younger brother, even though I had stitches at that time. My husband was unemployed for <DATE_TIME_001095> until <DATE_TIME_000816>. During this time, I was working to run the house, but my husband would drink and cause trouble. In <DATE_TIME_001096>, my husband said he wanted to start a business and asked me to arrange some money until his PF amount arrived. I thought he might improve, so I talked to my friend <PERSON_001329> and started a partnership business named AARVI COLLECTIONS in <DATE_TIME_001097>, which put me in debt of about â¹2 Lakh to <PERSON_001330>, which I am unable to repay. After that, my mother-in-law refused to keep my daughter, so in <DATE_TIME_001098>, I shifted to a rented house in <PERSON_001331>. Despite all this, my husband did not change. He joined a job at SHIP GLOBAL in <DATE_TIME_000816> and never paid attention to the business, losing approximately â¹2.5 to 3 Lakhs. Because of my husband, I have transferred about â¹10 to 10.30 Lakhs to him from my bank account over <DATE_TIME_001099> to fulfill his needs. I am heavily in debt because of him. I have also made several payments for his Private Loan Apps from my account. Then he used my Aadhar and 2 PANs to create accounts on those loan apps and took money, which I gave to him at his insistence, and he never repaid. I paid many installments for the iPhone he bought from my account. I also paid many installments for the <PERSON_001332> loan from my account. My husband did not give me money for household expenses. I also transferred money many times to repay his sister's â¹55,000. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law do not want me to be happy with my husband. Before <LOCATION_000298> in <DATE_TIME_001100>, my husband hit me by grabbing my hair. When I asked him to let me go, he closed the gate and beat me severely over this. During this time, I started feeling very unwell due to the dust and dirt from work. When I asked my husband to bring me medicine, he would beat me then too. <DATE_TIME_000534>, the matter would be sorted out, and to save my marriage, I never filed a complaint or got a medical examination. My elder brother passed away in <DATE_TIME_001101>. I came to my mother's house after asking him. They did not let me live with them. I would go home, clean, and come back. Sometimes I would stay for <DATE_TIME_001102>, but they did not treat me lovingly. When I asked my husband for money for household expenses, he would not give any, which led to fights and mutual verbal abuse. <DATE_TIME_001103>, when I was at my mother's house, he came home at <DATE_TIME_001104>, drunk. I told him to come to the police station now, asking if this was the time to come home. Then he took me from my house and took me to a secluded road and beat me severely on the road itself. After that, when I filed a complaint against him and his family at <LOCATION_000435> on 06/April/2024, he left me and went to live with his mother in a rented house. Despite my much pleading, he did not return. My husband often came home late, drunk, and caused trouble. I am very frustrated with his behavior, to the extent that I cannot even focus on my child's future because he has mentally tortured me so much. Since my marriage, my sister-in-law <PERSON_000092> and her husband <PERSON_001328> were living at my matrimonial home. They instigated my mother-in-law and husband against me. <DATE_TIME_001105> after the marriage, my mother-in-law, husband, and sister-in-law physically assaulted me multiple times. Even after she moved to her own house, she would visit my matrimonial home every <DATE_TIME_001106> and interfere a lot, calling my mother-in-law <DATE_TIME_000787> and taking all the news of the house. My sister-in-law and her husband asked me what problem I had with my husband, saying, \"He only drinks, he is doing everything for you, right?\" But I did not like my husband drinking. My in-laws and father-in-law listened only to my sister-in-law and her husband, and all work was done as per their instruction. At the behest of my brother-in-law, my in-laws and father-in-law expelled my husband and me from the house, and disowned us for show, forcing us to live in a rented house. They did not want me to live happily in my matrimonial home. My mother-in-law and husband would often snatch my phone at my sister-in-law's insistence so that I could not take any action against them or talk to my mother at home.]\nTable 4:\n[row_id: 255, StatementSignatory: SD Shraddhanand Sharma (Nunsar) 31/5/25 M. 98125-18750., PreliminaryPoliceAction: Today, upon the arrival of the application, and after finding the commission of offense under Section 305, 331(4) BNS, After registration, a copy of the case file along with the original application was taken by me, SI, along with Lady Constable Neelam 1011, and we proceeded to the scene of the incident., RegistrationAndLegal: Case No. 83 dated 31.05.2025 under Section 305, 331(4) BNS was registered at Behal Police Station., DispatchAndAssignment: Copies of the case have been prepared and sent to the Honorable Area Magistrate and Senior Officers via email/online ID rdrspbwn, dspsiwani, loharucourt@aij.gov.in.

My marriage took place on <DATE_TIME_001079> in the <LOCATION_000433> area. Within <DATE_TIME_001080>, my mother-in-law (<PERSON_000091>) and my sister-in-law (<PERSON_000092>) started taunting me and complaining about me to the maid. After my marriage, when I went to my mother's house for <PERSON_000886>, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law prevented my husband from coming to pick me up. My sister-in-law used to live at my matrimonial home and instigated my mother-in-law and husband against me. At their behest, they used to beat me severely and tell me to leave the house. At that time I was Pregnant and they asked me to abort the child. When I refused, my husband and mother-in-law would beat me and send me to my mother's house. During that time, they would block me and not speak to me, which caused me severe Mental Torture. My husband would constantly ask me for money to fulfill his needs and would deceive me into giving him money. All the savings I had before marriage were given to my husband, who promised to return them but never did. My mother-in-law told my husband to Divorce me and that they would arrange his second marriage. They put a lot of pressure on me to give them money, threatening to divorce me and remarry if I didn't comply. To save my home, I used to give them money. My husband would come home drunk every other day. When I forbade him from drinking, he would beat me badly, even during my pregnancy. His sister said, \"What's it to you? Let him drink, he's fulfilling your desires,\" even though neither my husband nor my mother-in-law ever bought me a single pair of clothes. My mother-in-law told me, \"I give clothes to <PERSON_000747> from my own side, so tell your mother to get you clothes.\" I told her that my father is not alive and my mother runs the household expenses with great difficulty, but they did not listen. My mother-in-law told me, \"Either I will stay in this house, or you will.\" She said this in front of my father-in-law, but he never said anything to her. He would see me being beaten by my mother-in-law and husband but never intervened. At my husband's insistence, I asked my mother for â¹2 Lakhs because he threatened to leave me if I didn't get the money. I took <DATE_TIME_001081> from my mother and transferred the entire amount to my husband as per his need via Bank Transfer. When I didn't have money to give them, they would mentally and physically torture me greatly. <DATE_TIME_001082>, when my father-in-law was eating stale bread, I took fresh bread for him. My mother-in-law taunted me, saying, \"Look, she brought bread, eat this.\" That morning, she created a lot of commotion over this. My husband was not even available at the hospital when my mother admitted me. When my daughter was born, neither my husband nor any member of my in-laws' family was available at the hospital. My mother took care of me and my daughter because my mother-in-law completely refused to help. In <DATE_TIME_001083> of my pregnancy, my husband took me to my mother's house. During that time, his mother was not talking to him. We stayed at my mother's house for <DATE_TIME_000834> because my in-laws did not want to take care of me and my daughter. Even after I, my daughter, and my husband returned home, they did not behave properly with me and they wouldn't even hold my child, only doing so when I was doing housework. We returned home in <DATE_TIME_001084>. On my wedding anniversary, <DATE_TIME_001085>, my mother-in-law organized a <LOCATION_000434> at my matrimonial home. My husband, his brother-in-law, and his cousins were sitting together and drinking. When I picked up an empty plate from there, my sister-in-law <PERSON_000092> created a big fuss <DATE_TIME_001086>, <DATE_TIME_001087>. The argument escalated, and my husband beat me and dropped me off at my mother's house and never came back to pick me up. I stayed at my mother's house until <DATE_TIME_001088>. They blocked me at the insistence of his mother and sister, and would not talk to me, saying they would leave me and didn't want to live with me. I filed a Complaint at Welcome Police Station. A Senior Officer counseled me and my husband. After that, I returned to my husband's house by a cab, the fare for which was paid by my mother. After <DATE_TIME_000031> of arguments, my mother-in-law sent me back to my mother's house. Then my husband told me that his family members did not want to live with me and that his brother-in-law <PERSON_001328> advised him to live with me in a rented house, promising they would look after me and my daughter. So, in <DATE_TIME_001089>, I shifted with him to a rented house in <LOCATION_000005>. All my Gold items were kept by his family, and they took my signature on a paper stating that they had returned all my gold, but they only returned small pieces. My husband said his mother was not home, and he would bring the rest later, but he never gave me anything back. I did not want any dispute at that time, so I accepted everything they said. On my husband's birthday, <DATE_TIME_001090>, he beat me badly, saying he was living with me leaving his parents. On <DATE_TIME_001091>, my husband also physically and mentally tortured me a lot. I wanted to save my home, so I never filed a case against my husband or sought any hospital examination, as I didn't want him to get into trouble. On my daughter's 1st birthday, <DATE_TIME_001092>, my husband beat me badly. In <DATE_TIME_001093>, I joined a Job to support my husband financially, as he was not managing household expenses properly, which caused me to incur a lot of debt. I started the job to pay off the debt and run the house properly, but my husband never let me utilize my earned money properly. My husband still asked me for money and did not give me money for household expenses. My husband took a loan from Muthoot using the small gold items my in-laws had returned, and then took that money from me via transfer for his own needs. My husband worked at DHL, but lost his job in Sep or <DATE_TIME_001094> due to some Fraud. He asked me for â¹55,000 to give there. When I didn't have the money, he verbally abused me and mentally tortured me. My husband used to slap me, punch me in the stomach, and pull my hair. He would say, \"Have you ever looked at yourself? I wouldn't even give a girl like you a second glance.\" This hurt me greatly. He called me a crazy woman and mentally depressed, even though they all together mentally tortured me. My mother-in-law and husband beat me a lot. During my confinement after childbirth (Japa), my husband punched me in the stomach in front of my mother and younger brother, even though I had stitches at that time. My husband was unemployed for <DATE_TIME_001095> until <DATE_TIME_000816>. During this time, I was working to run the house, but my husband would drink and cause trouble. In <DATE_TIME_001096>, my husband said he wanted to start a business and asked me to arrange some money until his PF amount arrived. I thought he might improve, so I talked to my friend <PERSON_001329> and started a partnership business named AARVI COLLECTIONS in <DATE_TIME_001097>, which put me in debt of about â¹2 Lakh to <PERSON_001330>, which I am unable to repay. After that, my mother-in-law refused to keep my daughter, so in <DATE_TIME_001098>, I shifted to a rented house in <PERSON_001331>. Despite all this, my husband did not change. He joined a job at SHIP GLOBAL in <DATE_TIME_000816> and never paid attention to the business, losing approximately â¹2.5 to 3 Lakhs. Because of my husband, I have transferred about â¹10 to 10.30 Lakhs to him from my bank account over <DATE_TIME_001099> to fulfill his needs. I am heavily in debt because of him. I have also made several payments for his Private Loan Apps from my account. Then he used my Aadhar and 2 PANs to create accounts on those loan apps and took money, which I gave to him at his insistence, and he never repaid. I paid many installments for the iPhone he bought from my account. I also paid many installments for the <PERSON_001332> loan from my account. My husband did not give me money for household expenses. I also transferred money many times to repay his sister's â¹55,000. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law do not want me to be happy with my husband. Before <LOCATION_000298> in <DATE_TIME_001100>, my husband hit me by grabbing my hair. When I asked him to let me go, he closed the gate and beat me severely over this. During this time, I started feeling very unwell due to the dust and dirt from work. When I asked my husband to bring me medicine, he would beat me then too. <DATE_TIME_000534>, the matter would be sorted out, and to save my marriage, I never filed a complaint or got a medical examination. My elder brother passed away in <DATE_TIME_001101>. I came to my mother's house after asking him. They did not let me live with them. I would go home, clean, and come back. Sometimes I would stay for <DATE_TIME_001102>, but they did not treat me lovingly. When I asked my husband for money for household expenses, he would not give any, which led to fights and mutual verbal abuse. <DATE_TIME_001103>, when I was at my mother's house, he came home at <DATE_TIME_001104>, drunk. I told him to come to the police station now, asking if this was the time to come home. Then he took me from my house and took me to a secluded road and beat me severely on the road itself. After that, when I filed a complaint against him and his family at <LOCATION_000435> on 06/April/2024, he left me and went to live with his mother in a rented house. Despite my much pleading, he did not return. My husband often came home late, drunk, and caused trouble. I am very frustrated with his behavior, to the extent that I cannot even focus on my child's future because he has mentally tortured me so much. Since my marriage, my sister-in-law <PERSON_000092> and her husband <PERSON_001328> were living at my matrimonial home. They instigated my mother-in-law and husband against me. <DATE_TIME_001105> after the marriage, my mother-in-law, husband, and sister-in-law physically assaulted me multiple times. Even after she moved to her own house, she would visit my matrimonial home every <DATE_TIME_001106> and interfere a lot, calling my mother-in-law <DATE_TIME_000787> and taking all the news of the house. My sister-in-law and her husband asked me what problem I had with my husband, saying, \"He only drinks, he is doing everything for you, right?\" But I did not like my husband drinking. My in-laws and father-in-law listened only to my sister-in-law and her husband, and all work was done as per their instruction. At the behest of my brother-in-law, my in-laws and father-in-law expelled my husband and me from the house, and disowned us for show, forcing us to live in a rented house. They did not want me to live happily in my matrimonial home. My mother-in-law and husband would often snatch my phone at my sister-in-law's insistence so that I could not take any action against them or talk to my mother at home.]\nTable 3:\n[row_id: 87, StatementSignatory: nan, PreliminaryPoliceAction: nan, RegistrationAndLegal: nan, DispatchAndAssignment: nan, _diagnostics_json: {\"notes\": {\"removed_headers\": false, \"joined_wrapped_words\": false, \"normalized_whitespace\": true}, \"model\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\"}, fir_id: C:\\Users\\dhrub\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hybrid-PrivacyQA\\dataset_folder\\FIRHarayanaTranslated\\18.json, year: 2025, fir_no: 67, police_station: BEHAL, fir_date: 30/04/2025, fir_time: 23:55:00, day_of_week: Tuesday, info_type: Written, direction_distance: East, 11 km(s), beat_no: nan, address: Bidhanoi, outside_ps_name: nan, name: Ramkishan, father_name: Dulichand, nationality: INDIA, uid: nan, passport_no: nan, occupation: nan, present_address: Bidhanoi, permanent_address: nan, section11: PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS ACT, 1960, Section 11; BNS 325/326(g); Animal Creation Act 11/59/60, inv_officer_number: 509, refused_investigation: nan, transferred_ps: On point of jurisdiction, transferred_district: nan, officer_name: RADHE SHYAM, officer_rank: Inspector, section15: nan, StatementOfComplaint_pseudo: In the service, the outpost in the service, <PERSON_000398> Mr. <PERSON_000384>, I request that I am a permanent resident of <PERSON_000399>'s son, <PERSON_000080>.

Complainant <PERSON_000900> (Sikh Community) had a love-cum-arranged marriage with <PERSON_000901> (Brahmin caste) on <DATE_TIME_000804> in <LOCATION_000194>. 2. The husband pressured the complainant to take a loan of â¹6 Lakhs (from HDFC) for the wedding expenses, with an agreement to share the repayment. The entire financial burden, totaling â¹11 Lakhs of the complainant's money (including â¹5 Lakhs savings and â¹6 Lakhs loan), eventually fell on her, as the husband was not financially stable. 3. The husband also took â¹2 Lakhs cash from the loan amount for clothes and travel expenses. The family was gifted items worth â¹9 Lakhs (Gold & Silver) and â¹3.5 Lakhs (additional items), including cash of â¹3,50,000/- but remained unsatisfied and taunted the complainant for the 'low-quality' dowry. 4. The in-laws constantly made defamatory remarks about her caste and religion (<NRP_000027>/Punjabi), saying her \"DNA is dirty\" and calling her family 'beggars' ('<PERSON_000902>') and saying they were 'cheated' by marrying into her family. 5. The husband slapped her in front of family members <DATE_TIME_000805> after the marriage and frequently humiliated her. When she retaliated, he dismissed it as 'just a joke.' 6. The mother-in-law (<PERSON_000903>) took all her money and jewelry (Stridhan) given as gifts under the pretext of 'safekeeping' and has not returned them (406 IPC). 7. She was not allowed to wear the traditional wedding bangle 'Chooda' because it was a symbol of a different caste. 8. The mother-in-law and sister-in-law (<PERSON_000904>) would create quarrels to prevent the couple from consummating the marriage or spending quality time together. They canceled their honeymoon trip, stating it wasn't their culture, and insulted her, saying, \"Your wife came from a foreign land, only the skin is fair, but her parents gave her no values.\" 9. The husband always treated her badly, saying he married her only for financial help and to use her money, threatening she could leave otherwise. He often used emotional blackmail regarding his parents' health to extract money and used to fight with her by slapping and pulling her hair. 10. The sister-in-law (<PERSON_000905>) told her to leave the house within <DATE_TIME_000806>, made defamatory remarks on her caste, and, along with the husband, taunted her by saying, \"Your father gave you away as charity to us to get rid of his trouble\". <PERSON_000905> also tried to burn her hand in the kitchen to 'teach her a lesson' for speaking up and threatened to kill her. 11. The elder brother-in-law (<PERSON_000906>) and his wife (<PERSON_000904>) were the main conspirators. They defamed her due to her caste. The brother-in-law did not attend the wedding and later sent her an indecent message calling her \"NANGI-PUNGI\". The husband ignored the message when shown. 12. The mother-in-law used to treat her like a maid, throwing things at her, and once threw a hot cup of tea on her, saying, \"What rubbish tea you made, didn't your mother teach you anything?\" She constantly forced the husband to choose between his mother and his wife, leading to severe beatings. 13. The in-laws were against her job. The husband forced her to quit her job in <LOCATION_000006>. Her sister-in-law (<PERSON_000907>) <PERSON_000904> would instigate the husband, saying, \"Your wife doesn't respect you because she earns more than you.\" 14. The in-laws, especially the mother-in-law and sister-in-law <PERSON_000904>, called Pundits (priests) to the house on two occasions (one in <DATE_TIME_000779> and one after she fainted during <DATE_TIME_000807>) and spread falsehoods in the neighborhood that the complainant was 'possessed' by a spirit and mentally unstable, and that her treatment should be done by '<PERSON_000908> (exorcism). 15. During the Diwali 2023 incident, her brother-in-law (<PERSON_000906>) threatened to ruin her and her family and said her DNA was 'dirty'.
